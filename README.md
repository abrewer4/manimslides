# Mr.Brewer's Maths Animations
### What is this?
I am a high school Mathematics teacher and I make animations for my lessons and for my students. This is where I keep them.

Lessons will be aimed at students in years 7-12, at various levels and in all different topic areas.

### How are these made?
I use the Maths animation tool ManimCE to create my animations. Everything is written in Python Code, before being rendered in video form. A plugin for ManimCE, Manim Editor, lets me export these videos as an interactive presentation, which I then upload here!
